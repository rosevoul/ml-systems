# CLIP

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020

Joint embedding space across text and images.

Key property:
contrastive learning at scale  
natural language as supervision  

Result:
image ↔ text alignment  
zero-shot behavior via prompts  

Recommender relevance:
cold-start items  
content-based retrieval without clicks  
cross-modal similarity search  

Typical usage:
- embed catalog images
- embed queries / descriptions
- cosine similarity
- ANN retrieval

Failure modes:
prompts brittle  
fine-grained preferences not captured  
bias inherited from web data  

Primary role:
representation layer  
not ranking, not generation
